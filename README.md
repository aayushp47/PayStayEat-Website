# PayStayEat-Website
It's a Paying Guest(PG) Website that offers Mess Services and Accommodations Facilities to Students

This project, named "PayStayEat," is a web-based platform designed to showcase and manage Paying Guest (PG) accommodations and mess services. The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly online presence for potential residents—specifically students and working professionals—to explore living and dining options, view amenities, understand pricing, browse a gallery, and facilitate inquiries or bookings.

The project is built using standard web technologies:

HTML5: The index.html file demonstrates the use of HTML5 for structuring all the content on the website, including headers, navigation, sections for home, about, rooms, mess, gallery, pricing, FAQs, and contact information.

CSS: The project links to an external style.css file, indicating the use of Cascading Style Sheets for styling, layout, and visual presentation of the web pages.

JavaScript: An external script.js file is linked, suggesting JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic elements to the website. This includes features like the image slider on the home page, the interactive FAQ section (where clicking a question reveals its answer), and potential hover effects on pricing cards.

Key Sections and Features of the Website:

Header and Navigation: A prominent header with the "PayStayEat" logo and title, along with a navigation bar that allows users to easily navigate to different sections like Home, About, Rooms, Mess, Gallery, Pricing, FAQs, and Contact. A "Register" button is also present, linking to a registration page.

It provides information on multiple mess services (e.g., Shital Mess, Pardesi Mess, Mahadev Mess), each with their weekly menus, daily prices, owner details, location (notably within DIT College, Pimpri), and contact information. Some messes also specify pure vegetarian options.
